Earthquake Data Visualization  - Analysis
------------------------------------------

In this part of the project, the goal was to visualize earthquake data using Leaflet.js and D3.js. The visualization was designed to display earthquakes worldwide from the past week, with markers that vary in size based on the earthquake's magnitude and in color based on its depth.

A functional interactive map was created, where users can:
-------------------------------------------------------------
View earthquake data from the past week on the map.
See different-sized markers representing the magnitude of earthquakes.
Observe color changes based on earthquake depth.
Click on markers to see detailed information in popups.
View a legend that helps interpret the color-coding based on depth.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
This part of the project demonstrated how to visualize real-time earthquake data using Leaflet.js and D3.js. The resulting map is interactive, easy to understand, and provides valuable insights into global seismic activity.
